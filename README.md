# Working Application
https://codepen.io/mookh01/full/EwZNVR/

# Objective
User Story: I can see performance time visualized in a scatterplot graph.

User Story: I can mouse over a plot to see a tooltip with additional details.

# Challenges
Confusion with D3 versions 3 and 4 have been the biggest challenge. Through enough reading and searches I've been able to get a better understanding of how the syntax is different and how it works. 
Others challenges was with text placement inside the scatterplot, it was a simple fix to just append the text to each circle created.
